#NightmareTrip

8 bit point'n click browser game based on original gameboy pallet.

My first real attempt of making a small game from the ground up, using javascript, html, css and maybe some php. Some of the schenes from the game are random pictures from the internet heavly edited to match the aesthetics of the game, witch means it's fair use (I hope), but all the rest is entirely made by me.
